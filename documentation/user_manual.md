# User's Manual - Podship

## Download the executable file for the game
Download [podship.jar](https://github.com/Granigan/otm-harjoitustyo/releases/download/beta1/podship.jar)

## Run the game
In the folder you downloaded podship.jar, run the command line command:

```
java -jar podship.jar
```

## Playing the game

Once you run the command, you'll see the start sceen. The game can be played with mouse, or with keyboard (move around with Tab and Shift-Tab, select with Space.)

Type in your name, and edit the starting stats if you wish. Due to input sanitisation the number you type into the stat field will show only after you hit Tab or select some other element. Finally, hit Launch to enter the Construction Phase.

### Construction Phase

![Construction phase](https://github.com/Granigan/otm-harjoitustyo/blob/master/documentation/images/ingame/intro.png)

Now you're in the main gameplay screen of the game. However, Podship being a turn based game, there's no rush. You can read the introduction on the screen, explaining you the situation. On the right you'll notice the statistics, all zeroes unless affected by your choices in the start screen.

After reading the introduction, you can proceed the game by making your first choice. Click one of the Option buttons.

You can also leave the game, or exit the program entirely.

After your first choice, you'll get a next one to make, and another, and so on. Unfortunately, this version does not yet have much of actual content, and thus nearly all of the events are random ones.

There are few actual choices to make as well though!


### Time to Launch
![Ready to go!](https://github.com/Granigan/otm-harjoitustyo/blob/master/documentation/images/ingame/readytolaunch.png)

Once you've made all the choices (very few turns in this version, as more content is ready, but the longer the build phase gets with more detailed choices to make) you'll be prompted to launch the ship. Say your prayers and do so!


### Travel Phase
![On our way!](https://github.com/Granigan/otm-harjoitustyo/blob/master/documentation/images/ingame/postlaunch.png)

After the launch you can but wait and see how the voyage fares. You'll get information of the events encountered, and how they'll affect the flight statistics on the left. If any of the resources runs out, the mission ends in a failure.

Again, unfortunately the content is not there yet, so the event consists only of random events.

### The End

Finally, the voyage comes to an end, one way or another. You'll get the score and if you did well, you'll claim a spot on the high score list on the main screen. (The high scores persist only while the game is still running, and are reset on restart.) Hopefully, you fared better than our unfortunate demo player...

### P.S.
Obviously, the game is but a technical demo at this stage. However, I wanted to prioritise being able to play it through over adding more content to it as that was more relevant to the course itself. Main upgrades will be adding Google Sheets support for hosting the content, and perhaps a local db for high scores. And of course all the wonderful content. Speaking of, here are few scenarios for the journey to end once the events are fully incorporated:

*Unmanageable breakdowns. Wear and tear is too much to keep up. The hulk reaches the target without ever slowing down, and carries on into the abyss with its mummified passengers.*

*Population grows weary of the journey and loses faith in the mission. General apathy and depression leads to significantly lowered birth rate. Eventually population goes beyond critical mass to ensure genetic diversity, and the survivors slowly degenerate into incompetence over generations. Final transmissions received from the ship are unintelligent nonsense and the ultimate fate of the ship remains unknown.*

*During an annual celebration, the AI turns out to be malevolent as it takes over the bridge with the help of maintenance robots. To ensure no one can threaten its existence, soon after the takeover life support is shut down. It is unknown whether the AI reached the destination on its own, or what it did once there.*

All this and more to come! Pre-order now!
